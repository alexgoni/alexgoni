Hello, I am a web frontend developer who strives to be a problem solver. 
I am highly interested in implementing digital twins and 3D information on the web to provide a new user experience. 
I also have practical experience in developing GIS web applications based on the Cesium library.

I am currently focusing on studying code that is easy to maintain, and I am gaining experience in both frontend and backend development. Through this, my goal is to become a full-stack developer.
